MooTouch
========

__A small "framework" to help in building applications with MooTools for touch-
capable devices.__

_The goal of this project is __not__ to provide an app-in-a-box framework that 
defines the layout, interactions and style. The goal is to provide touch and 
device-specific events and useful UI components/views for use in an application
you design yourself. It is meant to be used by people who know how to write code
and build their own apps._

Currently provides a native iOS scrolling emulation class.

All code works on old-school "desktop" browsers as well, as "mouse" events
are handled the same as touch events.

Build
-----

Build via [Packager](http://github.com/kamicane/packager), requires [MooTools Core](http://github.com/mootools/mootools-core), [MooTools Custom Event](http://github.com/cpojer/mootools-custom-event),  [MooTools Class-Extras](http://github.com/cpojer/mootools-class-extras) and  [MooTools Mobile](http://github.com/cpojer/mootools-mobile) to be registered to Packager already

	./packager register /path/to/mootouch
	./packager build MooTouch/* > mootouch.js

To build this plugin without external dependencies use

	./packager build MooTouch/* +use-only MooTouch > mootouch.js

To Do
-----

* Add compatibility for non iOS devices (e.g. Android)
* Add compatibility for non webkit browsers (e.g. Firefox?)
* Add UI/Control classes such as button, toggle, slider and popover.

MooTouch ScrollView
===================

A class to add iOS native-like scrolling to a given element. It strives in
every way possible to exactly duplicate the native behavior of iOS devices
including animation velocity, scroll indicator behavior, bounds handling and
pagination. Being a MooTools class, all of these traits (and more) are
provided as options creation time. Also, a full range of events are given
in order to inform and further customize the scrolling behavior.

_MTScrollView is part of the MooTouch family, and has some (light) dependencies
on it._

Currently Supports
------------------

1. CSS style-able scroll indicators that automatically hide and show themselves
2. Pagination - lock the scrolling on any axis to a specified grid. This is
   useful in creating a swipe-to-navigate interface such as the Photos app.
3. Fully customizable animation friction, velocity and duration.
4. Customizable out-of-bounds scrolling behavior.
5. Events. Events everywhere.
6. One, two or even three axis of scrolling at once.

How to use
----------

	#JS
	var scrollView = new MTScrollView(element);
	
That element will now be the wrapper/container for all of the scrolling 
content. It is advised that you give it a static size. If it is ever
resized, call scrollView.update().

You should also have some CSS to go along with the scroll view. Here is the
most basic:
	
	#CSS
	#id_of_element {
		position:relative;
	  overflow: hidden;
	}

If you need indicators, this will get you close to the native style:
	
	#CSS
	.indicator {
	  background:rgba(0,0,0,0.4); 
	  -webkit-border-radius:5px;
	  position:absolute;
	  opacity:0;
	}
	  .indicator.showing {
	    opacity:1;
	  }
	.y-axis-indicator {
	  width:5px;
	  min-height:10px;
	  top:0px;
	  right:5px;
	  margin:5px 0;
	}
	.x-axis-indicator {
	  bottom:5px;
	  margin:0 5px;
	  height:5px;
	}
